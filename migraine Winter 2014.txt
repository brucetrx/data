Migraine Headache
~ 44.5 million Americans suffer from migraines
(6-9% men; 18-24% women)
 Genetic factors – Chances of having migraines is
3X if immediate family member has migraines.
 Estimated loss of 113 million workdays a year
($13 billion)


Gastric Motility and Migraine


Oral absorption of drugs is slowed during
migraine:
Deceased GI motility – caffeine helps to reduce this
 Nausea/vomiting (90%)




Parenteral routes of administration should be
used



High variability with individual response to drug
therapy, therapeutic strategies must be
customized

Migraines have several phases
1. Prodrome
 ≤ 60%; changes in mood (depression, irritability,
etc…) & appetite (food cravings) that occur
hours to days before the migraine

2. Aura
 Migraine without aura (Common Migraine)
 Migraine with aura (Classic Migraine)
 ≤ 25 % of people with migraine

Visual disturbance – fortification spectrum

Migraines have several phases
3. Headache
 Progression from a dull ache to intense pulsations
 Usually unilateral and occur in the frontotemporal
region and may extend to the neck and back of skull
 Accompanied by nausea and vomiting (~90%)
 Photophobia and Phonophobia
 Migraine Lasts 4 -72 hours
 Symptoms improve with resting in a dark room and
worsen with physical activity
 More common in women versus men
4. Postdrome

Other migraine/head pain


B. Menstral migraine




Onset of menstration

C. Tension type headache
Dull, non-debilitating bilateral pain, non-pulsating
 No nausea/vomiting, no aura, no photophobia




D. Cluster headaches
Brief episodes of intense unilateral pain behind eye
 Very rare (0.07% of population)
 More common in males than females


Proposed theories for migraine
pathogenesis
Vascular theory – aura is due to vasoconstriction, pain
due to vasodilation
 Spreading depression – spreading decease in cortical
electrical activity
 Serotonergic abnormalities
 IV injection of 5-HT can abort a spontaneous or a
drug-induced migraine
 Drugs for Migraine work at the level of 5-HT
receptors
 Evidence of P/Q calcium channel mutations

Drugs for the Abortive Therapy of Migraine
Clinical Problem – Rebound
Headaches/Medication overuse Headaches







Rebound headaches are characterized by an increase in
headache frequency and an increase in drug
consumption
Combination analgesics, opiates, ergotamine tartrate
and triptans are associated with rebound headaches
To avoid the problem of rebound headaches abortive
therapy should be used ~ 2 times a week
Only botulinum toxin is useful relieving medication
overuse headaches

Drugs for the Abortive Therapy of Migraine

Analgesics - effective in treatment of mild to moderate
migraine

NSAIDS
 Relative efficacy of the different NSAIDS for treating
migraine has not been clearly established


Mechanism of action appears to be related to the ability
to block prostaglandin synthesis and prevent
inflammation in the trigeminovascular system



Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease,
renal disease or hypersensitivity to aspirin.

Drugs for the Abortive Therapy of Migraine
Analgesics - effective in treatment of mild to moderate
migraine


Acetaminophen – efficacious in treating
migraine pain and symptoms including
photophobia and phonophobia

Drugs for the Abortive Therapy of Migraine
Analgesics - effective in treatment of mild to moderate
migraine


Midrin

Isometheptene – vasoconstrictor
 Dichloralphenazone – sedative
 Acetominophen
 One of the oldest migraine medications. In 2013,
the availability is sporadic due to FDA regulatory
issues. Efficacy needs to be proven.
 Similar drug Prodrin is available
(Isometheptene+caffeine+acetaminophen)


Drugs for the Abortive Therapy of Migraine
Opiates (e.g. Butorphanol)


Reserved for severe infrequent headaches where conventional
therapies are contraindicated or when rescue medication is
needed.



Nasal administration of butorphanol can provide an alternative
to frequent visits to the hospital for injectable migraine therapies.



Butorphanol is a controlled substance and can be addictive, long
term therapy should be closely monitored.



Adverse effects include dizziness, nausea/vomiting, drowsiness,
bad taste

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)

Historically drug of choice for acute migraine
attacks that are unresponsive to non-narcotic
analgesics. Now the “_triptans” are first line
drugs.
Chemistry, History and Pharmacokinetics 
Ergot alkaloids are compounds that occur
naturally in rye (and other cereal grains)
contaminated with the fungus Claviceps purpurea


Epidemics of “ergotism” have been reported
throughout history; influenced battles, Salem
witch trials

Claviceps purpurea on
wheat

C. purpurea also
contains the
psychoactive drug LSD

Famous painting of
ergotism effects

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)
Chemistry, History and Pharmacokinetics –

Ergotamine tartrate is available in oral, sublingual and
suppository dosage forms

The maximum oral/sublingual dose should not exceed 6
mg/attack or 10mg/week . The half life or ergotamine is ~2
hrs, however ergotamine-induced vasoconstriction can last
~24 hrs

Caffeine is added to some ergotamine containing products to
potentiate vasoconstriction and improve intestinal absorption.

Some ergotamine mixtures contain belladonna alkaloids
(atropine) to reduce nausea and vomiting and barbiturates for
sedation

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)
Pharmacodynamics –

Ergotamine is a dirty drug and interacts with serotonin,
dopamine and adrenergic receptors.

The effectiveness of ergotamine for migraine can be seen in
figure 1 of the handout

Activation of 5-HT1B receptors and vasoconstriction

Reduce neurogenic inflammation by decreasing the release of
vasodilator/proinflammatory neuropeptide transmitters (e.g.
substance P, neurokinin A, CGRP)

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)
Toxicity, adverse reactions and contraindications –
Powerful vasoconstrictor –

Partial agonist at alpha-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2
receptors, contraindicated in patients with peripheral
vascular disease.

Beta-blockers may potentiate vasoconstriction caused
by ergotamine. Patients on both medications should
be closely monitored

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)
Toxicity, adverse reactions and contraindications –
GI upset – nausea, vomiting, anorexia


Occurs in ~10% of patients due to activation of
central dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor
trigger zone.



This side-effect may require adjunct therapy with
an antiemetic e.g. 10 mg oral Metoclopramide
(e.g. Reglan).

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Ergotamine Tartrate (Ergomar)
Toxicity, adverse reactions and contraindications –

The Macrolide antibiotic erythromycin can
interfere with the liver metabolism of ergotamine
and may cause ergot toxicity (severe peripheral
vasospasm, ischemia, cyanosis, numbness).

Contraindications – Cardiovascular disease, sepsis,
liver and kidney disease and pregnancy/breast
feeding

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45) – Acute treatment of
moderate to severe migraine

Chemistry and Pharmacokinetics

Incompletely absorbed form the GI tract and is
administered parenterally (IM,SQ) or via a nasal
spray (Migranol)
Pharmacodynamics – similar to ergotamine
Toxicity, adverse reactions, and contraindications

similar to ergotamine except dihydroergotamine
causes vasospasm less than ergotamine

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Sumatriptan (Imitrex) – Triptans are used for the acute
treatment of moderate to severe migraines

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Chemistry and Pharmacokinetics

subcutaneous injection, oral tablets, nasal spray or transdermal
patch (2014)

Metabolized by MAO-A/Contraindicated with the use of a
MAO inhibitor W/I a 2 week time span after discontinuing
MAO therapy

Triptans can be administered up to 4 hrs after the onset of a
headache and still be effective
Pharmacodynamics

Sumatriptan is an agonist at type 1 serotonin receptors, similar
action as the ergot alkaloids

Relieves nausea/vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Toxicity, adverse reactions, and contraindications

Cardiovascular (coronary spasm, myocardial infarction,
ventricular arrhythmias)

Several fatalities reported with subcutaneous sumatriptan
due to myocardial infarction

Do not give by IV due to due to the risk of vasospasm

Use of sumatriptan is contraindicated within 24 hrs of
treatment with an ergot due to the risk of additive
vasospastic effects.
Triptan Symptoms

Common with Sumatriptan and newer triptans, chest and
throat tightness, difficulty breathing, panic/anxiety,
parathesias, feeling of heaviness

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
2nd Generation Triptans


Like Sumatriptan these drugs act at the peripheral
components of the trigeminovascular system



Due to greater lipid solubility they also act centrally to
inhibit pain transmission in the trigeminal nucleus
(see Figure 1)



Better oral absorption versus sumatriptan (Imitrex)

Drugs for the Abortive/Acute Treatment of Migraine
Metoclopramide (Reglan), Prochlorperazine (Compazine) and
Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)


These dopamine antagonists are useful for the
treatment of acute migraine attacks that are
unresponsive to Sumatriptan, DHE or oral analgesics



Relieve headache pain and have anti-emetic activity

Drugs for the Prophylactic
Management of Migraine






Consider prophylactic therapies with patients
who don’t respond to acute therapies or who
use acute therapies > twice a week
Patients need to stay on these therapies for 2-3
months before they are considered ineffective.
If effective patient should stay on the drug for 3
- 6 months, after this time you can try to remove
the drug to determine if remission has occurred.

Drugs for the Prophylactic Management of
Migraine
beta-blockers – drug of choice for migraine
prophylaxis
Propranolol and timolol are FDA approved for migraine


Metoprolol, Nadolol and Atenolol are also effective



Mechanism of action is not clear but these drugs do have some
affinity for serotonin receptors



Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (partial
agonist) e.g. Acebutolol, Pindolol, and Penbutolol are not
effective and should not be used for migraine thearpy

Drugs for the Prophylactic Management of
Migraine - Other Drugs
Amitriptyline (Elavil)






Mechanism of action of Amitriptyline is unknown,
independent of antidepressant action, may involve
down-regulation of central 5-HT2 and adrenergic
receptors
Sedation and anticholinergic side-effects (dry mouth,
blurred vision, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmia)
Fluoxetine (Prozac) has fewer anticholinergic side
effects – but clinical data for use in migraine is lacking

Drugs for the Prophylactic Management
of Migraine - Other Drugs
Calcium Channel Blockers – Verapamil (Calan,
Isoptin)


Typically less effective than other prophylactic medications , use
if other drugs don’t work in a patient.



Mechanism of action may be due to alteration of vascular
smooth muscle or changes in neurotransmitter release.

Drugs for the Prophylactic Management of
Migraine - Other Drugs
Antiseizure Drugs – valproic acid:valproate(Depakote);
Topiramate (Topamax); Gabapentin (Neurotin) – Antiepileptic

neurotransmission, modulate glutamate, inhibit sodium and
calcium channels
Valproic acid:Valproate Sodium: nausea/vomiting, weight gain,
tremor, hair loss, hepatic toxicity, teratogenic (neural tube defects)
Topiramate – paresthesia, fatique, anorexia/nausea, diarrhea,
weight loss, memory problems (cognitive slowness)
